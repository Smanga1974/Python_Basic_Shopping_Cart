# Python Basic Shopping Cart

This project is a simple command-line shopping cart application written in Python. It was developed as part of the "FNB_week8_project".

## Features

- Add items (foods) to your virtual cart.
- Enter the price for each item.
- View a summary of all items added.
- See the total price of your shopping cart.

## How It Works
